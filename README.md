#Dgls

An efficienty and easily tool.

##Overview

Dgls means "Dynamically Generate Label String". We can use it to gereate a structured label string efficiently and easily.
I write this tool because I think that "Ajax + innerHTML + Something = Better User Experience + High Performance + High Efficiency".
The Something is exactly what I want to do. So Dgls come out！

##How to use it?
